# SQL Mystery in C++

 Background: The project is itself based upon the reimplementation of CS50's problem set  [Fiftyville](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2024/psets/7/fiftyville/) within C++.
 
 Fiftyville is a CS50 Problem set which dwells into solving a investigation in the fictional town of Fiftyville. The user is provided with a SQLite database and the user has to surf across the schema.
 
##  Getting Started
###  1) Setting up:
Let's get started with the tools we need.

- A [GitHub](https://github.com/) account
- An [Edx](https://edx.org) account
- A [VS code](cs50.dev)

###  2) Do the Following
- Bookmark [CS50 Website](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2024/)
- Share your GitHub Username in the group
- Use the online [VS Code](cs50.dev) to solve the pset

### 2) Watching Lecture:
On the CS50 website scroll to week 7 SQL and watch the lecture.
Note: 
- The lecture itself makes some use of python code but however you can just bear it for 20 mins.
- It's assumed that you understand and are comfortable with typing commands in the terminal

P.S you have been doing this all along when you would compile c code e.g gcc -o.

### 3) Watching Additional Suppliment Course
- Shorts
- Section

P.S these above are optional and only meant to explain some of the concepts and assist you in understanding.

### 4) Solving Pset
Solve the Three Pset
