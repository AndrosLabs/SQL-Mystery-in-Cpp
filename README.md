# SQL Mystery in C++

 Background: The project is itself based upon the reimplementation of CS50's problem set  [Fiftyville](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2024/psets/7/fiftyville/) within C++.
 
 Fiftyville is a CS50 Problem set which dwells into solving a investigation in the fictional town of Fiftyville. The user is provided with a SQLite database and the user has to surf across the schema.
 
##  Getting Started
###  1) Setting up:
Let's get started

- Create a [GitHub](https://github.com/) account and share your username within the group 
- Create an [EdX](https://www.edx.org/learn/computer-science/harvard-university-cs50-s-introduction-to-computer-science?webview=false&campaign=CS50%27s+Introduction+to+Computer+Science&source=edx&product_category=course&placement_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.edx.org%2Fcs50) account to enroll in CS50
- Access the [VS code](cs50.dev) in the web browser and play around for a while
- Bookmark [CS50 Website](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2024/)

### 2) Watching Lecture:
Watch the Week 7 Lecture by Clicking on menu.
The database will be covered from the scratch and you don't need any prior experience, so don't worry. Always if feeling overwhelmed, take it slow but you will understand everything along the way.
Note:- If you feel overwhelmed by the terminal commands, then reach out for help.

### 3) Watching Shorts & Section
These are additional short videos to help you get the grasp of the concepts taught in the lecture. Be sure to watch them to get more comfortable

### 4) Solving Pset
It's time to face the final boss. Pset contains multiple problems, one of them being fiftyville. Solve all of them and work you way up to fiftyville.
